  "total_description": "The true costs - or full costs - of mobility are the sum of personal costs and external costs. The external costs are not carried by the traveler, but society as a whole.",
  "social_description": "Externalities arise when the activities of a person or company have an impact on third parties that are not included in the price. This effect can be both positive (external benefits) and negative (external costs). \nIn terms of mobility, external costs mean that the costs of transport activities are not carried by the travelers themselves, but by society in general.",
  "personal_description": "Personal costs – or internal costs - are borne by the users themselves. These internal costs can be both tangible and intangible. In terms of mobility, these might be monetary costs for vehicles (purchase, operation, disposal or repurchase) or for a public transport ticket.",
  "detail_social_description": "The external costs are clustered into three categories: time, health, and environment. The time dimension includes congestion costs and time losses due to barrier effects (cause by infrastructure). The health dimension includes the costs caused by noise, accidents, and air pollution. The environment dimension includes costs due to climate damage and space consumption.",
  "detail_social_time_description": "The time dimension includes congestion costs and time losses due to barrier effects.",
  "what_are_congestion_costs": "What are congestion costs?",
  "detail_social_time_description_congestion": "Congestion in road traffic or delays in public transport lead to time losses, which can be assessed in monetary terms with the help of willingness-to-pay approaches. Other negative effects of congestion are increased fuel consumption and wear and tear on roads and vehicles.\n\nThe total congestion costs for Munich (INRIX Traffic Scorecard) are allocated to individual modes of transport based on the space required and the vehicle kilometers traveled. In public transportation, average delays are used to calculate congestion costs.",
  "what_are_barrier_costs": "What are costs due to barrier effects?",
  "detail_social_time_description_barrier": "Wide road and rail routes with high traffic loads lead to restrictions for other forms of mobility. For example, pedestrians and cyclists must take detours to cross the infrastructure barrier. In addition, the spatial separation of districts can result in reduced economic productivity.\n\nThe monetary costs of these barrier effects have been estimated in various studies. Corresponding cost rates per vehicle kilometer have been adopted for the online tool.",
  "detail_social_health_description": "The health dimension includes the costs caused by noise, accidents, and air pollution.",
  "what_are_noise_costs": "What are noise costs?",
  "detail_social_health_description_noise": "Noise from road and rail traffic causes disturbances and harms human health. This causes damage to society in the form of loss of value of real estate, reduced quality of life, as well as treatment costs and productivity losses due to physical, cognitive, or psychological impairments.\n\nThe amount of the noise costs is determined by the number of persons affected per level class, measured in dB(A). The total costs are then divided among the individual means of transport using weighting factors and mileage.",
  "what_are_accident_costs": "What are accident costs?",
  "detail_social_health_description_accidents": "Traffic accidents cause medical costs, property damage, losses due to work absences, administrative expenses, and intangible costs (e.g., suffering and shock).\n\nOnly personal injury is included when calculating external costs, as property damage is largely covered by motor vehicle insurance and is therefore part of the personal costs.\nThe police accident statistics provide information on the accident’s severity, road users involved, and the causer.\n\nWith the help of appropriate cost rates, the total cost of each accident can be determined. The accident costs are allocated to the modes of transport according to the polluter pays principle (costs are allocated to the mode of transport causing the accident) and the damage potential principle (allocation is based on mass and speed).",
  "what_are_air_costs": "What are costs due to air pollution",
  "detail_social_health_description_air": "Air pollution occurs both in vehicle operation through fuel combustion and abrasion and during fuel production. The consequences are material damage (e.g. to buildings), crop damage, biodiversity loss and damage to health (especially due to respiratory diseases).\n\nThe cost rates for various air pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides or ammonia, come from the Federal Environment Agency's Methodological Convention 3.1.\n",
  "detail_social_environment_description": "The environment dimension includes costs due to climate damage and space consumption.",
  "what_are_climate_costs": "What are costs due to climate damage?",
  "detail_social_environment_description_climate": "Greenhouse gas emissions are generated during fuel combustion in the vehicle and during the production of fuels and energy. In the atmosphere, greenhouse gases lead to a change in the climate – with negative consequences for ecosystems, human health, and food production.\n\nThe Federal Environment Agency recommends the damage cost approach for determining climate damage. This involves estimating the damage caused by a given amount of greenhouse gases emitted. For this purpose, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are converted into CO2 equivalents.",
  "what_are_space_costs": "What are costs due to space consumption?",
  "detail_social_environment_description_space": "Transportation needs space for driving and parking. The calculations in this online tool consider the city of Munich’s investments in road traffic, public transport, and bicycle traffic. In addition, so-called opportunity costs arise, as the space cannot be used for other purposes. In the case of cars, the costs for construction and maintenance of parking, as well as the income from parking fees, are also considered.",
  "detail_personal_description": "These costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs include costs such as vehicle depreciation. The variable costs are kilometre-dependent costs, such as fuel costs. The cost rates for bicycles and e-bikes include depreciation (fixed costs) as well as tyres, maintenance/repairs and electricity costs (variable costs). The fixed costs for the car include the subcategories depreciation, insurance, tax, MOT and parking. The variable costs include fuel costs, maintenance, repairs, tyres and care.",
