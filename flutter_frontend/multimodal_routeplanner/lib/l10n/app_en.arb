  "description_internal_costs": "The direct costs borne by users of a mode of transportation, such as fuel costs, maintenance, and insurance.",

  "description_noise": "The effects of noise are noticeable in various areas of life. Thus, traffic noise causes costs for a national economy in several respects.",
  "description_space": "Transport uses land in two different traffic situations. Land is used for moving traffic via streets or rail systems. At the same time, vehicles that are not moved occupy space for parking.",
  "description_congestion": "Congestion is mostly known for blocked streets by cars and other road users. However, there are also a lot of congested public transport networks which lead to delays. For both cases, time is lost and thus costs are generated.",
  "description_barrier": "The barrier effect describes the time delay that motorized transport imposes on active mobility forms. This could be in the form of big streets pedestrians have to cross or circumvent to reach their destination.",
  "description_environment": "Costs due to environmental damage include all damages caused today and in the future by climate change, associated with uncertainties. They depend on the propulsion type of the vehicle and include costs from the operation of the vehicle as well as from the fuel and power production.",

  "social_description": "Externalities arise when the activities of a person or company have an impact on third parties that are not included in the price. This effect can be both positive (external benefits) and negative (external costs). In terms of mobility, external costs mean that the costs of transport activities are not carried by the travelers themselves, but by society in general.",

In terms of mobility, these might be monetary costs for vehicles (purchase, operation, disposal or repurchase) or for a public transport ticket.",
